                    Welcome to our Training Site. <br />Listed below are this quarters available classes for our electricians to take, in order for them to actively keep up with the always advancing technologies and/or brush up on their skillsets. If you find something you yourself are interested in please go ahead and sign up for the class! We look forward to having you join us for some informative training and instructive hands-on electrical experience here in the near future!

                    <p>
                        Explain the fundamental concepts of designing, providing, and maintaining electrical control for motors. The class content first addresses the main elements of motors and the principles that make motors work, with several classes devoted to reading the symbols and line diagrams used to represent electrical circuits. Advanced-level classes focus on simple to complex control devices--the physical switches, contactors, and relays that open and close electrical circuits, allowing motors to perform useful work.

                        examine solar cells to learn how they convert the sun's energy directly into
                        electricity. In the process, you will learn why we are getting closer to using the sun's energy on a
                        daily basis, and why we still have more research to do before the process becomes cost effective.

                        A programmable logic controller (PLC) or programmable controller is a digital computer used for automation of electromechanical processes, such as control of machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or lighting fixtures. PLCs are used in many industries and machines, such as packaging and semiconductor machines. Unlike general-purpose computers, the PLC is designed for multiple inputs and output arrangements, extended temperature ranges, immunity to electrical noise, and resistance to vibration and impact. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed or non-volatile memory. A PLC is an example of a real time system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a bounded time, otherwise unintended operation will result.
                        This course will begin by examining the system components in a SLC 500 modular PLC system and the AB SLC 500 family PLC’s.
                        Then, the course will explore the programmable controller fundamentals and system installation as well as programming software. The course will conclude with lessons on timers and counters, as well as shift registers and sequences

                        Introduction to the basics of instrumentation, including
                        definition of commonly used instrumentation terms and symbols, and an overview
                        of the physical parameters of industrial measurement and control; pressure, flow,
                        level, and temperature. Covers complex material such as; configuration and
                        calibration, including proper documentation. Both bench calibration of analog
                        instruments and communicating with and configuring digital or “smart”
                        instruments are covered in great detail. The class finishes with fundamental of
